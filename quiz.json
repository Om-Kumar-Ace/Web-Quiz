It consists of three-nucleotide sequences called codons, each of which codes for a specific amino acid. There are 20 common amino acids, and each amino acid is coded for by at least one codon.\n\nThe genetic code is characterized by the following properties:\n\n* It is **specific**, meaning that each codon codes for a specific amino acid.\n* It is **universal**, meaning that the same codon codes for the same amino acid in all organisms.\n* It is **non-overlapping**, meaning that each nucleotide is used only once in a codon.\n* It is **degenerate**, meaning that most amino acids are coded for by more than one codon.\n\n**Non-polarity** is not a characteristic of the genetic code. Non-polarity refers to the chemical nature of certain amino acids, not to the genetic code itself. Polar amino acids have charged side chains, while non-polar amino acids have uncharged side chains. The polarity of an amino acid affects its solubility and its interactions with other molecules.\n\n**Additional context:**\n\nThe genetic code was first deciphered by Marshall Nirenberg and Har Gobind Khorana in the 1960s. They used a technique called cell-free protein synthesis to determine which codons coded for which amino acids. The genetic code has since been found to be universal in all living organisms, with a few minor exceptions.",[

The main difference between them lies in the presence or absence of a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the second carbon atom.\n\n* **Ribose:** Has a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the second carbon atom (2'-OH).\n* **Deoxyribose:** Lacks the hydroxyl group at the second carbon atom and instead has a hydrogen atom (-H) attached to it.\n\n**Why is the answer correct?**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between ribose and deoxyribose. The answer, \"Hydroxyl group at 2nd carbon,\" correctly identifies that the presence of a hydroxyl group at the second carbon atom is what distinguishes ribose from deoxyribose.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* Ribose is found in RNA (ribonucleic acid).\n* Deoxyribose is found in DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).\n* The absence of the hydroxyl group at the second carbon atom in deoxyribose makes DNA more stable and less prone to hydrolysis (chemical breakdown).\n* The hydroxyl group in ribose allows for the formation of secondary structures, such as hydrogen bonding and base pairing, which are crucial for the function of RNA.",[

It is a molecule that contains the instructions for an organism's development and characteristics. \n\nDNA is mainly involved in the synthesis of RNA (ribonucleic acid) through a process called transcription. RNA is then involved in the synthesis of proteins through a process called translation. Therefore, DNA is indirectly involved in the synthesis of proteins.\n\nProteins are synthesized on ribosomes, which are structures in the cell that read the genetic code in RNA and assemble the correct sequence of amino acids.\n\n**Additional Context:**\nDNA is a double-stranded molecule that forms a helix shape. Each strand of DNA is made up of a series of nucleotides, which are composed of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. \n\nThe four nitrogenous bases in DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). The sequence of these bases along the DNA strand determines the genetic code for an organism.\n\nDNA is found in the nucleus of cells.

Each tRNA molecule carries a specific anticodon that is complementary to the codon (a sequence of three nucleotides) on a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. During protein synthesis, the anticodon on the tRNA molecule binds to the complementary codon on the mRNA molecule, bringing the correct amino acid to the ribosome for incorporation into the growing polypeptide chain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question \"Anticodons are found in:\" is **tRNA**.\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n* **Codon:** A sequence of three nucleotides on an mRNA molecule that codes for a specific amino acid or a stop signal.\n* **Ribosome:** A complex structure in the cell that assembles proteins based on the sequence of codons on mRNA molecules.\n* **Protein Synthesis:** The process of assembling proteins by joining amino acids together in a specific sequence.",[

The four nitrogenous bases found in DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil (U).\n\n**Phosphorus** is not found in nitrogenous bases. Instead, it is found in the sugar-phosphate backbone of nucleic acids. The sugar-phosphate backbone forms the structural framework of nucleic acids and plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and integrity of the DNA or RNA molecule.\n\n**Additional context:**\n\n* Nitrogenous bases pair up with each other through hydrogen bonding to form base pairs. In DNA, A pairs with T, and C pairs with G. In RNA, A pairs with U, and C pairs with G.\n* The sequence of nitrogenous bases in DNA and RNA determines the genetic code and provides instructions for protein synthesis.\n* Phosphorus is also an important component of many other biological molecules, such as phospholipids (components of cell membranes) and ATP (the energy currency of cells).",[

This process is carried out by the ribosomes in the cytoplasm of cells.\n\n**The steps of translation are as follows:**\n\n1. **Initiation:** The ribosome binds to the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule at the start codon (AUG). A specific transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule carrying the amino acid methionine (Met) binds to the start codon.\n2. **Elongation:** As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, different tRNA molecules carrying specific amino acids bind to their complementary codons on the mRNA. The amino acids are then linked together by peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain.\n3. **Termination:** Translation is terminated when a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is encountered on the mRNA. The polypeptide chain is released from the ribosome and folding begins to form the functional protein.\n\nTherefore, translation is the process that converts the genetic information in nucleotides into the amino acid sequence of a protein.",[
